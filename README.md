# mcRP (Minecraft Roll Play) #

## What is mcRP? ##
mcRP is a plugin that aims to create an RPG feel on minecraft servers. It comes bundled with pre-packaged skills, damage effects and more! 

mcMMO and similar plugins are "monolithic". This makes them hard to use with other plugins which affect gameplay as conflicts can occur and in many instances it can open up holes for cheaters. This plugin intends to be as lightweight as possible, as to allow multiple plugins to be combined without conflict.
